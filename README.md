# Customer Clustering and Churn Prediction in a Bank

In this project a solution for the customer churn* in a bank is presented. The model can be divided into two goals: split customers into groups of highly similar members (clustering) and predict by means of deep learning the churn risk of individual customers. 

This study, together with the expertise of professionals of the sector, could put a solution to this major issue. Furthermore these results are not exclusive for banks: any type of institution/company with a large number of customers and where loyalty becomes a valuable feature (either in customers or employees) could benefit from it.
