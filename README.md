# Customer Clustering and Churn Prediction in a Bank

In this project a solution for the customer churn* in a bank is presented. The model can be divided into two goals: split customers into groups of highly similar members (clustering) and predict by means of deep learning the churn risk of individual customers.

The application of the model here presented would translate in a positive economical impact for the institution. Furthermore these results are not exclusive for banks: any type of institution/company with a large number of customers (or employees), where loyalty represents a valuable feature, could benefit from it.

*\*churn: referred to the action of ceasing relationships with an institution or company.*
